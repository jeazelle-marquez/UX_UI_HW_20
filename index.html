                <h2>Mid-Fidelity Prototype</h2>
                <p class="para">Once I had a visual direction of the layout, I began to add more details and precisions to the sketches by turning them into mid-fidelity wireframes. Mid-fidelity wireframes allow me to focus on the visual consistency and hierarchy before applying styles. In these wireframes, I tried to incorporate common design patterns that have been tested on our competitors' product, or included elements that directly address users' goals, needs, frustrations, and motivations. As I am designing an app for iOS system, I referred to the Human Interface Guidelines of Apple in the design process.</p>

                <h2>Guerrilla User Tests</h2>
                <p class="para">To get feedback for my mid-fidelity prototype, I finalized a guerrilla user test plan. The main goal of the test was to identify the negative and positive experiences while using Local Lens.</p>

                <h2>Conducting User Tests</h2>
                <p class="para">My target audience for the user tests were travelers of ages 18+ seeking locally recommended accommodations and activities to book for their next vacation. I was able to conduct in-person and remote usability testing with 3 participants, and created notes for each participant based on my observation of their interaction with the prototype. Before the test, I asked each participant to talk through their thought process and to tell me their confusions.</p>

                <h2>Results Analysis</h2>
                <p class="para">In order to fully analyze the research and rank the feedback, I broke down the findings into three sections: observations, inferences, and recommendations. Observations is simply jotting down each comment, interferences is prioritizing each comment, and recommendations is the final changes that need to be made based on the results.</p>

            <h3 class="mainTitle1" id="highFi">High-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
            <p class="para">Once the user feedback from the mid-fi prototype was analyzed, changes in regards to the boldness of buttons and labels as well as additional features (filters and language options) were made. All of the recommendations developed through the results analysis were added to the new high-fidelity prototype. From there, the high-fidelity prototype was brought to life with color, text and photos.</p>

            <h4 class="subTitle2">FINAL THOUGHTS</h4>
            <p class="para1">Being that this was my first prototype, I did not realize that being too ambitious with the app features can creep on you during the wireframe development process. There were times when I would lose focus on which features I should concentrate on first. In addition, it was difficult to keep track of all the features I wanted to include, which created more stress and confusion. From this process, I learned to always refer back to the user research data to remind yourself of the purpose of the app.</p>
            <h4 class="subTitle2">NEXT STEPS</h4>
            <ul class="list1">
                <li>Conduct more user tests and make iterations from there</li>
                <li>Decide on color scheme and test out different colors schemes with users</li>
                <li>Add a “Safety” tab with tips from locals</li>
